# Ethereum-Smart-Contract-Generation-and-Analysis
In this repo we are going to analyze the state of the abilities of LLMs in the context of code generation, particularly for the generation of smart contracts in Solidity, in the Ethereum blockchain.

*Analysis:*

Contains everything regarding the analysis phase, all the files needed to analyze the contracts that we generated.

1. Mythril and Slither script files are used to perform the analysis using Slither and Mythril over all the contracts inside a folder.
2. The plotting files analyse the output of the scripts and extract the relevant data, also generating plots.
3. slither-analysis and mythril-analysis are the output of the analysis of 250 contracts generated by DeepSeek-Coder.

*Plotting:*

Here we have all the plots generated during our studies.

*Generated:*

Contains the contracts generated using DeepSeek and GPT together with the CSV for both models. 
The CSV is used to link the prompt to the actual generated contract.
